# schrodinger_equation_for_free_particle
Schrodinger equation for free particle solved using finite difference method, coded in Scilab.


You will find two files: 
schrodinger equation .sce: it will show you a gaussian curve which corresponds to the probability density of a free particle
schrodinger equation v3 .sce: it will show you the wave function of a free particle as it evolves in time and it will end up as a wave packet as it should


For now, the code is for Scilab.
Will soon publish the code in python as well.
